# DataSciWorldGDP
Data science project about finding primary data(s) that influence GDP value of countries.

Originally made for Stamford International University's ITE224 Data Science course.

Update: I've noticed the files I uploaded originally were missing the final versions and have sinced added them approximately 18 hours prior to this. All files are now accounted for.

Primary code file is Regression.ipynb
